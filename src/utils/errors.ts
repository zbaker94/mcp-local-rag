// Shared error taxonomy foundation.
//
// `AppError` is the abstract base every domain error class extends. It carries
// two discriminants — `layer` (which architectural layer raised it) and `kind`
// (the nature of the failure) — so a single boundary mapper can convert errors
// to client codes and to logs without each handler re-deriving identity.
//
// This module is behavior-preserving on its own: it adds the `layer`/`kind`
// metadata and centralizes `cause` storage, while the concrete classes keep
// their existing names, messages, and `cause` semantics.
